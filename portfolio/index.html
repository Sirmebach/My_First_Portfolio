    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Samuel Mwangi Karanja. My friends call me Sam. I was born in a small town called Nanyuki in Laikipia county
            at the slopes of Mount Kenya. I grew up strong swimming in rivers, playing in the mad,hunting for rabbits and antelopes
            catching colds, breaking my bones and getting into fights like every other young boy in the village. I later joined 
            high school where my passion for football was elevated and even joined our school team where I played as a defender and many 
            are times when we would go home with trophies of victory.
        </p>
        <p>Later, I joined college and there, I realised that the older that I got, the smaller I felt. The world was becoming wider and 
            wilder. I was studying Building and Construction and graduated with a lower credit. It was hard getting a good job, so I 
            started as an unskilled labourer, a newbie who just graduated from school, pushing myself higher and higher to an artisan,
            then to a foreman, to a Clerk Of Works and then later to a site engineer.
        </p>
        <p>I later joined a company called <strong>COLOTUNES&trade;</strong> Kenya Limited and here, I work as a machine operater and a paster. 
            All this time, I had a craving to understand the tech world and how it worked. This was triggered by a realisation that 
            everything in our world was revolving around internet and technology. I wanted to be a part of this new wave called technology.
            I joined one of the most renown and best online school in Africa and the world at large called <strong>ALX</strong>. I started as a student doing 
            Front-End Web Development and here I am illustrating what I have learnt so far.
        </p>
        <p>I aim to become a full stack web developer and continue going up the ladder and be the best person in the world of technology
            and innovation. I want to be in a position where I will make the world a better place through technology.
